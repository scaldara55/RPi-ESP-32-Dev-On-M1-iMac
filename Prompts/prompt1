Act as a software developer familiar with the ESP-32 and micropython.
I'm using the ESP-32 dev kit v1 WROVER.
I want to connect a Si7021 temperature and humidity sensor to it over the I2C bus.
Which pins ong the ESP-32 dev kit should I use?
I want a micropython script that does the following:
1. Runs immediately from power on.
2. Initializes the the Si7021
3. Opens a local file with using the current date and time for a filename.
4. Collects both temperature and humidity every 15 seconds.
5. Writes it to a text file in csv format.
6. The column headings are Date, Time, Temperature, Humidity.
7. After 3 minutes have elapsed data collection stops.
8. The file is closed.
9. Control returns to the REPL prompt.

Write me a product requirements document using ASCII text.
